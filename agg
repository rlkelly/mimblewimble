One Way Aggregate Signature


The links between inputs and outputs are obfuscated because using OWAS, multiple transactions can be
grouped together into a larger transaction such that no links between the inputs and outputs of the original
transactions remain. The knapsack problem [3] is used for additional anonymity. Our anonymity comes in
the form of plausible deniability [4] (“you may have done it but we cannot be sure”).
