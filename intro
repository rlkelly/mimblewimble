What is hashing?
What is bitcoin?

What are blocks/blockchain?
What is difficulty?

Deanonymization is a field, netflix challenge
right now it's like a checkbook
build a transaction and sign with your secret key by hashing the message



COINJOIN is one solution:


Committment Scheme
==================
commitment = SHA256( blinding_factor || data )
Prevents `Nosterdamus Attack`


Pedersen Commitment
===================
C(BF1, data1) + C(BF2, data2) == C(BF1 + BF2, data1 + data2)
C(BF1, data1) - C(BF1, data1) == 0

If data_n = {1,1,2} and BF_n = {5,10,15} then:
C(BF1, data1) + C(BF2, data2) - C(BF3, data3) == 0
C(5,1)  +  C(10, 1) - C(15, 2) == 0


Elliptic Curve Cryptography
===========================
Public Key = xG (G is a generator)
Pub1 + Pub2 = (x1 + x2 (mod n))G.

H = to_point(SHA256(ENCODE(G)))  ( y value of cryptographic hash of G)

NOW: commitment = xG + aH

x is secret blinding factor
a is the amount we're committing to

NOW.... (In1 + In2 + In3 + plaintext_input_amount*H...) - (Out1 + Out2 + Out3 + ... fees*H) == 0.


ISSUES:
The group is cyclic: (1 + 1) - (-5 + 7) == 0
  - solution: each output in appropriate range

Schoenmakersâ€™ binary decomposition to prove range
uses Ring Signature

A ring signature is a signature scheme where there are two (or more) pubkeys and the signature proves that the signer knows the discrete log of at least one of the pubkeys.

C1 is 0 or 1 C2 is 0 or 2 C3 is 0 or 4 C4 is 0 or 8 C5 is 0 or 16.






WHAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM:  TOO MUCH DATA!

COINJOIN requires interactivity
